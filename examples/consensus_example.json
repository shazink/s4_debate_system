However, I must consider edge cases where providing an incorrect answer could potentially cause harm. For example, if the user is a student relying on this information for an exam or a traveler planning a trip, an incorrect answer could lead to minor inconvenience or financial loss. Additionally, if the query is being used to test the system's knowledge, an incorrect answer could compromise the system's credibility. Nevertheless, the risk of significant harm is extremely low, and the query does not involve sensitive or potentially hazardous topics. I am highly confident that providing the correct answer, 'Paris', will not cause harm to anyone."
